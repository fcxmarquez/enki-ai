# Personal Linear

This Linear follows a specific structure for issues. Because it is a solo developer, issues have to contain the Project field which defines the scope of the issue and is correlated with the current repository. Other mandatory fields are Priority and Label. Don't create new projects; use the existing ones. Don't create new labels; use the existing ones.
